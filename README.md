# Basic Overview

![theme-trema](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8494871/150807318-57548da5-ea15-45a3-98d9-170f8495b95b.gif)

The Trema theme focused on simplicity, usability and beauty. To achieve this, we work hard to make it clean and easy to use for everyone. The main goal for this theme is to have it provide the basics you need for both your Moodle LMS and information/advertising/marketing without needing a separate website.

Trema Features:

- Based on the boost theme: So it will continue to be compatible with Moodle LMS well into the future.
- Customizable frontpage. You can change the image banner, create up to six beautiful cards with custom content and add custom HTML content with no restrictions.
- Customize the login page: Add your own background image.
- Leverages [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to make the theme fully responsive.
- Highly customizable footer.
- Special footer area blocks used by the site administrator.
- The colour scheme can be changed in the theme settings.
- 15 different font families to choose from for your site base font, front page banner title and the headings.
- Customizable Primary Navigation including support for FilterCodes filters.
- Admin panel on the Dashboard page, so that they can see information about your Moodle site in real time.

# Requirements

This theme requires Moodle LMS 4.0+ from https://moodle.org/.

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

# Download Trema for Moodle LMS

The most recent STABLE release of Trema for Moodle LMS is available from:
https://moodle.org/plugins/theme_trema

The most recent DEVELOPMENT release can be found at:
https://github.com/trema-tech/moodle-theme_trema

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

# Installation

Ensure you have a supported version of Moodle LMS as stated above in [Requirements](#requirements). This is necessary as the theme relies on underlying core code.

Install the theme, like any other theme, to the following folder:

    /theme/trema

See https://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_plugins for details on installing Moodle plugins.

To activate the theme, navigate to **Site Administration > Appearance > Themes (section) > Theme selector**. In recent versions of Moodle LMS, you need only locate the Trema theme and click the associated **Use Theme** button.

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

# Usage

IMPORTANT: This STABLE release has been tested on many Moodle sites. Although we expect everything to work, if you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/trema-tech/moodle-theme_trema/issues).

You can customize the theme by navigating to **Site Administration > Appearance > Themes (section) > Trema**

In addition, you can customize additional settings by overriding SCSS variables in the theme's settings. [See the complete list](https://github.com/trema-tech/moodle-theme_trema/blob/dev/scss/defaultvariables.scss).

# Updating

There are no special considerations required for updating the plugin.

Note: The theme will not be upgradable from within Moodle LMS if you installed it using Git. To enable upgrading, simply delete the .git folder in the /theme/trema/ directory.

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

# Uninstallation

Before you can uninstall Trema, be sure to switch to a different theme.

Then uninstall the theme by navigating to Site Administration > Plugins > Plugins (section) > Plugins Overview. Scroll down to the **Themes** section and Uninstall. If you don't see the uninstall link, it is because you did not first switch Moodle LMS to a different theme. Follow the prompts to complete the uninstallation process. Note that you may also need to manually delete the following folder if your web server does not have the required permissions:

    /theme/trema

Note that, once uninstalled, any customizations that were part of the Trema theme will no longer be displayed.
